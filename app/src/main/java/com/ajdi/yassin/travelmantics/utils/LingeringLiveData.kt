/**
 * A LiveData that allows its resource management to follow its active state,

 * resources to remain active during an Android configuration change.  For
 * example, if it's expensive or undesirable for a LiveData to detach and
 * reattach a listener to some resource because of a configuration change,
 * LingeringLiveData softens that cost by allowing it to keep that listener
 * attach during the change.  The downside is that the resource doesn't get
 * released at the very moment that it might no longer be removed.
